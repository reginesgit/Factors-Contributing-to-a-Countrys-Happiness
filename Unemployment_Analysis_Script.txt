Unemployment Analysis
This analysis served to study the correlation between the overall unemployment rate in each country and its happiness score. The analysis was based primarily on two different datasets â€“ one measuring happiness and the other unemployment. Both datasets contained data over the same time frame, 2015 to 2019.  The hypothesis being that there is an inverse correlation between unemployment rate and the happiness score. 
The datasets came from two different sources and did not contain the same countries. Specifically, the happiness dataset from Kaggle contained information for 141 countries. The unemployment dataset, on the other hand, came from the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database (International Monetary Fund) and included over 200 records. After cleaning and merging these datasets, the final dataset only included 85 records. The merge was conducted using the names of the countries and it is very likely that differences in the ways in which they were spelled in each dataset affected the result. 
Nevertheless, analysis showed a moderate correlation between unemployment rates and happiness scores. The r-value of -0.36 demonstrated that there is a negative moderate correlation, in other words, a higher unemployment rate is likely to result in a lower happiness score. The overall correlation calculation is affected by the sample size. Of the 85 records, about six were potential outliers and were excluded from the above calculation. When included, these outliers bump the overall r-value to -0.40. 
Another factor that could potentially impact these values is the access of information. Was it easier for happier countries to present information? Were countries with higher employment rates more likely to share information? There is no way to definitively answer this question, however, it is likely that these factors are important. For example, there was no available data on the countries with the lowest happiness scores. Most of these countries had suffered from political turmoil during the timeframe covered in the dataset and it is likely that information was not easily available.
