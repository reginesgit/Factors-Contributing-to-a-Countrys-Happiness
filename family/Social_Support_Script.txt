My question was how the social support score was correlated with the happiness index.
To begin n this project I combened the yearly happiness index csv files, cleaned and renamed the combined file.
I ran a regression analysis to determine correlation between social support and happiness.
I found a strong positive relationship between the two with a r-square 0.78 
Since social support and charity are related I was curious how these two are connected to happiness. I did an analysis with social support and generosity vs happiness.
These are some of the findings I have
* Iceland was always on the top in terms of social support score, but the  happiness index was not the highest
* Toga has the lowest level of social support, but the happiness index is not the lowest.
* Myanmar is the top country in terms of generosity, but its happiness index is below 4.5
In summary, lack of social support seems to affect the happiness index up to a certain level, but the correlation between these two are not linear.
Also, generous countries were not automatically happy until social support was added in too. 
We like to think this says people in general are good, and want to make others happy, even if they are not happy themselves.
